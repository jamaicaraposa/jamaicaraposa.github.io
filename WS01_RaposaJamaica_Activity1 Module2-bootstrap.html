      <h1>Hello, It's Me!</h1>
    <p>  I am Jamaica Raposa, resident of Balingasay, Bolinao, Pangasinan, 21 years of age, born on seventh day February, year 2001.
 We are nine in the family. My father's name is Diosdado Raposa, he is a carpenter. 
My mother's name is Maryjane Raposa,a housewife, mother of seven. 
I have three brothers, two of them are older than me, named Eric and John Michael. 
The younger one is Jester Kenneth, the youngest among us siblings. 
I also have three sisters, my older sister Kristine Mae and the two who's younger than me, Saena and Janela Harvey.
<br><br>
If I am to describe myself, I'm short, I can't deny. Not beautiful but cute, in short,cute size.
 I have four furbabies, three cats named Musang, Mitot and Chichi, and a dog named Ice. 
I do love cats and dogs specially may pets for they are my stress reliever. I am interested ni music.
 I dream to play and own a guitar then write my own songs.
 My hobbies are watching Korean Dramas, Thai Series and Animes, reading books specially novel. 
I do love to write poems at times but today, I am focusing on improving my Math skills. 
Someday I'll be a Math Teacher, a great one.</p>
